# Environment

Operating system: Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS

## Full nodes
In order to provide environment for relayer 2 full nodes were deployed on same server as Relayer:
 - BitSong (chain-id: bitsong-2-devnet-2)
 - Sentinel (chain-id: bluenet-1)
Installation of full nodes for both chains is not in scope of this guide.

**NOTE:** Nodes were reconfigured in order to co-exist on same server and do not cause port conflicts. Each node is running on dedicated, separate user account for seurity reasons.

## Relayer
Hermes relayer version 0.7.0 will be used
 - Repository: https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs
 - Documentation: https://hermes.informal.systems/


# Pre-requisites

## Create user
```bash
adduser relayer
```
**NOTE:** All Build and configuration steps with Hermes Relayer will be done in context of this user. Running service as normal non-privileged user is good security practice and same time provides separation of the service environment from other services/applications running on server.


## Additional packages
```bash
sudo apt install make clang pkg-config libssl-dev build-essential git jq llvm libudev-dev -y
```

# Relayer installation

**NOTE:** Installation steps should be doe as *hermes* user.

## Rust installation
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source $HOME/.cargo/env
```


### Relayer deployment
```bash
git clone https://github.com/informalsystems/ibc-rs.git
cd ibc-rs
git checkout v0.7.0
cargo build --release --bin hermes
```

**NOTE:** Once relayer is built binaries are stores in *${HOME}/ibc-rs/target/release* folder. I moved binaries to *${HOME}/.local/bin* along with binaries for each chain: *kid* and *rizond*. Then logoff and logon, so search path will be added to *${HOME}/.local/bin* folder.


# Generating keys
For testing purposes 4 keys will be creates. Two keys for relayer (one in each chain) and two for transactions (one in each chain).


## Relayer Keys

### BitSong
```bash
bitsongd keys add relayer-bitsong --output json > keys-bitsong.json
```

```json
{
    "name": "relayer-bitsong",
    "type": "local",
    "address": "bitsong1ryczwfsja2wpusfexuaeg34fzwwmfu26tvdc6r",
    "pubkey": "bitsongpub1addwnpepqtc8g6y8s42umqwhhc2uc0s9phzjaflxnprwsk73hhel8kf8zku57cjvd92",
    "mnemonic": "MNEMONIC SEED"
}
```
**NOTE:** Make sure content of JSON file generated by *keys add* has exactly same struture as example above.

### Sentinel
```bash
rizond keys add relayer-sentinel --output json > keys-sentinel.json
Enter keyring passphrase:
Re-enter keyring passphrase:
```

```json
{
    "name": "relayer-sentinel",
    "type": "local",
    "address": "sent1f60g0wjks00zck8nqgq3saa8ffqvtrdhsp97an",
    "pubkey": "sentpub1addwnpepqgrfz5pwjwj4xw43j27fxqcezjrf8sskn209z9m5xeeq7m8rh3wwxvpyyhq",
    "mnemonic": "MNEMONIC SEED"
}
```
**NOTE:** Make sure content of JSON file generated by *keys add* has exactly same struture as example above.



## Transaction Keys
Transaction keys will be used to send test transactions. That **should not** be done using Relayer account.

Keys will be created also on Hermes user account, for testing purposes.
Make sure that binaries (bitsongd and sentinelhub) are available on ${PATH}.


### BitSong (bitsong-2-devnet-2)
```bash
bitsongd keys add qf3l3k-ibc
```

```yaml
- name: qf3l3k-ibc
  type: local
  address: bitsong1w27uqt3m02j82nu0x96ut8yflrj3f0kzlg5lgc
  pubkey: bitsongpub1addwnpepqwh2x5rrgjunq6radzze9v62uykxgu82se53scuc7vvpq0lk5wx36nq4ajx
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

MNEMONIC SEED
```

### Sentinel (bluenet-1)
```bash
sentinelhub keys add qf3l3k-ibc
```

```yaml
Enter keyring passphrase:

- name: qf3l3k-ibc
  type: local
  address: sent19s8flsrd0u93c6x94ln49sl0fuxnp92j4awxrk
  pubkey: sentpub1addwnpepq24q9hgvxutjyt4grmcmrk3039yhczcz5q4ntxzs9e89av33sy2fjq7n72x
  mnemonic: ""
  threshold: 0
  pubkeys: []


**Important** write this mnemonic phrase in a safe place.
It is the only way to recover your account if you ever forget your password.

MNEMONIC SEED
```


# Relayer configuration

**All activity will be done in context of *hermes* user, which is account created specifically to run relayer.**

Default folder for Hermes is *${HOME}/.hermes*, so it needs ot be created
```bash
mkdir -p ${HOME}/.hermes
```

Configuration file *${HOME}/.hermes/config.toml*
```toml

**NOTE:** Ports for RPC services were changed as both nodes are running on same machine. THis is specific to test configuration.


## Add Keys to Hermes Configuration

### Sentinel
```bash
hermes keys add bluenet-1 -f keys-sentinel.json

Sep 02 22:46:03.939  INFO using default configuration from '/home/relayer/.hermes/config.toml'
Success: Added key 'relay-sent' (sent1zuv7qy786msa86npvpuze876wukg2zu5c2s0cs) on chain sentinelhub-2
```
